# MegaConvertor

This is one of the more practical applications, designed for day-to-day use. It allows the user to convert different units of measure from 6 fields: temperature, length, time, weight, pressure and currency. The currency converter uses live rates, retrieved from the web via CSS selectors (when online), or the last stored rates (when offline).
